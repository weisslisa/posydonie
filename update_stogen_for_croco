# ADAPT STOGEN IN CROCO COMPILATION TESTS

* Problem with the order in which the STOGEN routines are compiled 
- include in `./OCEAN/Makefile` the list of STOGEN routines in `SRCS90 =` in the right order od dependencies
- add a space between `stoexternal` and the coma in all STOGEN routines dependencie calls

* `stoexternal.F90`
